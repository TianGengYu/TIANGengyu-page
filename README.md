## Project Reflection
1. What have you done in this exercise?
Created a GitHub repo, drafted personal info in aboutme.md, used AI Agent Mode to generate a responsive personal site (HTML/CSS/JS with Tailwind), ran Git commands (add/commit/push), deployed via GitHub Pages, and used Ask Mode to clarify code.
2. What have you learnt?
Key skills: GitHub Codespaces setup, basic Git version control, AI-driven multi-file web development, GitHub Pages/ Actions deployment, and structuring prompts for targeted AI outputs.
3. What do you think about this exercise?
Highly practical—combines AI tools with real-world dev workflows, beginner-friendly, and delivers a shareable result quickly, bridging theory and hands-on practice.
4. Is the AI output meeting your expectations?
Yes—generated a functional, responsive layout fast. Works: follows structure from aboutme.md; Doesn’t work: minor tweaks needed for custom styling.
5. Any challenges encountered?
Initial confusion with GitHub Pages source setup; resolved via docs.
6. Most unexpected part?
AI Agent’s ability to coordinate multi-file generation (HTML/CSS/JS) without manual file linking.
7. Most useful technique/prompt?
Structured prompts: "Read aboutme.md, create responsive site with Tailwind (index.html/styles.css/script.js)"—ensures AI aligns with requirements.
